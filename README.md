## Introduction

Welcome to this repository containing basic class diagrams, interaction diagrams, domain models, and use cases. These diagrams are essential components of Enterprise Architecture. This subject holds significant importance in the field of software engineering, as it helps in understanding, designing, and managing complex systems within an enterprise context.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for understanding fundamental concepts related to Enterprise Architecture. By studying these diagrams, individuals can gain insights into how various components interact within a system, how entities are organized within a domain, and how use cases are defined and implemented.

## Contents

- **Class Diagrams**: These diagrams depict the structure and relationships of classes within a system.
- **Interaction Diagrams**: These diagrams illustrate the dynamic behavior of a system by showing how objects interact with each other over time.
- **Domain Models**: Domain models represent the concepts and relationships within a specific problem domain.
- **Use Cases**: Use cases describe the interactions between actors and the system to achieve specific goals.
